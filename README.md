## Project Overview
Given the broad scope to our cinema-management-API:
- We have designed a cinema API which uses POJOs and allows you to select information from our different models and get this brought up in Postman and Postico.
- A handy API allows cinemas to validate tickets, manage revenue, screens, movies and showtimes. It also allows customers to book movies' tickets and choose seats.
- We have used Java as our primary Backend language, but have also used SQL for the data.

How we worked together to build an MVP:
- As part of the Bright Network Technology Academy, we were assigned a group project to research, plan and develop an API within a week.
- Our main challenges included removing dependency loops between screening, screen, movie and cinema models, fixing foreign key constraints, and version control errors. 
- To mitigate our issues we regularly discussed them with one another, and would ask for help when we needed it. Our teamwork was key for getting us to complete this project together.

## Install and Run

1. This Spring Boot API runs on Java 17. Ensure you have an IDE, API platform and PostgreSQL client before running this API. We used IntelliJ, Postman & Postico, respectively. 
2. Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:YoyoMai98/cinema_project.git`. Open project in IDE.
3. Create a database called “cinema_app” (`createdb cinema_app`); this will allow you to use your PostgreSQL client to view your tables.
4. Run the application and open your API platform. Interact with the API and make HTTP queries via `localhost:8080/{query}` in the CLI.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

For our MVP, we created an API with partial functionalities to manage cinemas. It focuses on one cinema and allows cinemas to add new movies, cancel movies, search for movies, add new screens and manage customers.

It includes 5x models classes:

- Cinema
- Customer
- Movie
- Screen
- Screening

## Extensions

What Yongran has expanded on this API:

- Handle multiple cinemas with different branches
- Change `Cinema` and `Movie` relationship to many-to-many
- Add `showTime` and `endTime` properties in `Screening` model
- Create `Booking` model to handle seats and price for a ticket
- Add `revenue` property in cinema
- Ticket Authentication

It allows users to manage revenue, manage multiple cinemas, cancel movies for one cinema, manage show time and end time for movies, book movies' tickets with chosen seats and validate a ticket.


## Using the API - HTTP Requests
Notes:

- Filters for String - this allowed us to use derived queries with "ContainingIgnoreCase" to reduce user input error and offer multiple options in e.g. movies genres.

`localhost:8080/…`

## Further Extensions

Here are a few ideas on how we would like to expand on this API:
- Create `Genre` table to list movies’ genres in one cinema
